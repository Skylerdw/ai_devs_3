GoHighLevel Guide - McKinley Restoration

Purpose
We've implemented GoHighLevel to streamline our lead management process from our new flat roof landing page (mckinleycompany.com/flatroof/). This initiative is primarily targeted at companies, and our ads will run daily from 6:00am to 4:30pm.

Lead Handling
- Dawid will handle requests in the morning.
- From 9:00am to 5:00pm, Monica and Alexis will share the workload, as assigned by Matt.

This system helps us:
